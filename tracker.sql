The loud bang echoed through the quiet air. A bird, beautiful and free just moments before, fell lifeless to the ground. I stood there, stunned. The man walked away as if it meant nothing. I wanted to shout, to question him—Why? But I couldn’t find the words. I just stared at the small, delicate body of the bird lying motionless in the dirt. It wasn’t for food.

I’m tired of disappointing everyone. It feels like I’ve become a burden — like the world would be better off without me. I’ve tried everything I know to feel better, but nothing works anymore.

I woke up with a tight chest and a lingering sense of dread I couldn\'t really explain. I stayed in bed for almost an hour after waking up, scrolling on my phone, avoiding the day. But I eventually got up — and that’s something I need to recognize as a win. I didn’t have any panic attacks today, but I did feel overwhelmed around noon. My thoughts were racing, especially about work and whether people secretly think I’m not doing well. I keep telling myself that even if I’m struggling internally, showing up matters. I took a break, made some tea, and did a few grounding exercises — the 5-4-3-2-1 one helped a bit.

My friends and I are finally on our long-awaited trip to Bandarban – the land of hills, clouds, and breathtaking silence. We kicked off the morning at 5 AM (yes, miraculously, everyone was up on time!). Wrapped in jackets and sleepy excitement, we hopped on a local jeep and began our ride to Nilgiri. The air was chilly, and the sky slowly lit up with a watercolor sunrise. With every turn on the hilly road, laughter filled the jeep – someone cracking jokes, another blasting our favorite road trip playlist. Once we reached the Nilgiri viewpoint, we were greeted by a sea of clouds! It was like standing above the world. We all went silent for a few moments, soaking it in – the kind of silence that only true friends understand. Then of course, came the photos! Jump shots, group selfies, dramatic poses – we made sure to capture every second.\n\nLater, we trekked through a nearby trail leading to a small tribal village. Along the way, we saw wildflowers, colorful butterflies, and even a few curious monkeys. We shared water, helped each other across slippery rocks, and sang loudly, disturbing the peace (oops). Reaching the village, we were welcomed with warm smiles and fresh bamboo juice. It felt like time had stopped. Our evening was just as magical. Sitting around a campfire at our cottage, we roasted marshmallows, played truth or dare, and shared stories we never thought we\'d tell. The sky above us was full of stars – real stars, like in movies – and for once, no one was on their phone. It was just us and the night. This trip isn’t just about traveling; it’s about the bond we’re building – stronger with every shared moment, every inside joke, and every “remember that time when…” I know these are the days we’ll look back on and smile. I’m so grateful for this journey and the people by my side. Here\'s to more adventures, more surprises, and many more sunsets together.','2025-07-07 02:21:01',4,'Very positive',60,28,2,4,6),(37,'marjia','Today was such a fun and refreshing day! I spent the afternoon playing games with my friends, and it honestly made me forget all my stress for a while. We laughed so much, shouted at each other during close matches, and completely lost track of time. We played a mix of games — some classic ones like Ludo and UNO, and then jumped into some online multiplayer games too. The energy was high, and everyone was so competitive, but in the best way. At one point, we teamed up for a co-op game, and the coordination (or lack of it!) had us all cracking up. There’s just something so special about these moments — no pressure, just good vibes, and shared joy. I’m really grateful for days like this. It reminded me how important it is to have fun and spend time with people who make you smile.','2025-07-07 04:14:17',4,'Very positive',63,29,5,1,1),(38,'anika','My name is Anika.
